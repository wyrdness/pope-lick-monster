## Overview

The Pope Lick Monster is an urban legend from Louisville, Kentucky, centered on a railroad trestle over Pope Lick Creek. Described as a human-goat hybrid with a human body, goat head, horns, and fur-covered legs, the creature allegedly lures people onto the active train trestle using hypnosis, voice mimicry, or by chasing them with a bloody axe.

**While the creature itself is legendary, the danger is very real**: the trestle is an active railroad bridge, and **multiple people have been killed by trains** while trespassing to search for the monster. Deaths have been documented since at least 1987, making this one of the most dangerous urban legends in America.

Origin theories include an escaped circus freak, a reincarnated farmer, or a victim of Satanic rituals. The legend serves as a tragic example of how folklore can lead to real-world harm.
